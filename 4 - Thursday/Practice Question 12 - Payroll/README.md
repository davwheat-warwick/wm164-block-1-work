# Practice question 12

## Payroll

> Design a Payroll class that has data members for an employee’s hourly pay rate and number of hours worked.
>
> Write a program with an array of seven Payroll objects.
>
> The program should read the number of hours each employee worked and their hourly pay rate and call class functions to store this information in the appropriate objects.
>
> It should then call a class function, once for each object, to return the employee’s gross pay, so this information can be displayed.
>
> Sample data to test this program are as follows:
>
> | Hours | Rate  |
> | :---: | :---: |
> | 40.0  | 10.00 |
> | 38.5  | 9.50  |
> | 16.0  | 7.50  |
> | 22.5  | 9.50  |
> | 40.0  | 8.00  |
> | 38.0  | 8.00  |
> | 40.0  | 9.00  |
