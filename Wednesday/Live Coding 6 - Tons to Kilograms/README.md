# Practice question 6

## Tons to Kilograms

> The conversion factors for converting between imperial tons and pounds and kilograms are:
>
> - 1 imperial ton = 2240 pounds
> - 1 imperial ton = 1016.05 kilograms
>
> Write two functions toPound and toKilogram, each of which accepts a weight in imperial tons as an argument and returns the weight in pounds and kilograms respectively.
>
> Write a program that calls the functions in a loop to generate a table of conversions from tons to pounds and kilograms, from 2 tons till 20 tons, in increments of 2 tons.
