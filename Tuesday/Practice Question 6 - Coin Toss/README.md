# Practice question 6

## Coin toss

> The outcome of tossing a fair coin can be either 'Heads' or 'Tails'.
>
> Write a program to simulate a coin toss. The program should ask the user to enter either 'H' or 'T'. The program should then simulate tossing the coin by randomly generating either 1, representing heads, or 0, representing tails.
>
> If the user's choice matches the outcome of the toss, the program should display 'You win.' Otherwise, it should display 'You lose.'.
